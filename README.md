## This is a dynamic clamp README for Kv3.4

The dynamic clamp code has been modified off of Niraj Desai 2017 "A Dynamic Clamp on Every Rig" https://www.eneuro.org/content/4/5/ENEURO.0250-17.2017.

This has been adapted for Hodgkin Huxley modeling of Kv3.4-PM and Kv3.4-PN based on a previously published paper in _J Neurosci._ 2022 "Tunable Action Potential Repolarization Governed by Kv3.4 Channels in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons" https://www.jneurosci.org/content/42/46/8647.abstract
